# **Truck detection using Hough and SVM**


###### Required information of Dataset source:
1. ***https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Vehicle-Detection***
2. ***http://www.gti.ssr.upm.es/data/Vehicle_database.html***
3. ***http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/***


First we took our image array divided into car and no car.
An example is shown below

We conver the image into a grayscale using OpenCV library
Using cv2.cvtColor().

#### **HOG FEATURE EXTRACTION AND TRAINING DATASET CREATION**

We apply HOG method on the image array to get the corners.

hog(image_gray, orientations = 11, pixels_per_cell = (16, 16), cells_per_block = (2, 2), transform_sqrt = False, 
visualize = True, feature_vector = True)

We get feature and the resultant image like below.

#### **SVM MODEL CLASSIFIER TRAINING**

We created a train ,test split and train our model LinearSVC() on the training data and also we imporved
our model using GridSearchCV to find best parameters.

We got c =100 and gamma =1 as our best parameter.



#### **TEST THE MODEL (FIND CARS)!**

We used our testing data to test the model.We took a image below

We took ou ROI by resizing the image as below.

This is the final output. I am working on a better model and also working on to capture the same using my videocam.
Cheers!
